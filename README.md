# YoYoProject
A C# Library for serializing, deserializing and manipulating GameMaker: Studio 2 Projects

Maintained by: DatZach

## Current Status
This library is very early in its development lifecycle. Please mind the mess.
There's still a ton of research being done into how things work so things are still being
rapidly prototyped.

## License
This project is licensed under MIT.

I'll fill this readme out more later...
